## 5.1 and 5.2 Notes
###5.1
- Computing innovations are created by people, and enable shifts into the way people program tasks (need to accommodate)
- Effects of computing innovation -- it can be effective and beneficial and harmful by diff or same people, even just one effect 
- Computer innovations have enabled innovations in medicine, engineering, etc. 
- Originally World Wide web = intended for rapid and easy exchange of info between scientific community
- Targeted advertising -- mostly used to help business, but can be misused by individuals
- Machine learning can enable data innovation in many fields, but can also be used as discrimination.
- Multirotor: benefits and harmful effects
### 5.2:
- The internet has a digital divide
- Which means that there is a DIFFERING amount of access to the internet based on a variety of characteristics
- Socioeconomic status, geographic status, or demographic characteristics
- This digital divide can affect a lot of people
- Differences in countries can also impact this digital divide based on what the government allows and if computers are not common in the area

### 5.1 Activity
Question 1:

I think that one beneficial aspect of computing is the increased security we have been able to provide in certain situations. Apps like life360 can help parents track and ensure their kids are getting home safely, and apps like Find my I phone have been used to make sure expensive devices are not lost. Convsersley, this ability of technology to have so much information on other people, cna lead to unsafe online situations. People can use apps like isngtagram, facebook, etc, and alot of the time this becomes the root of issues like stalking, or cyberbulling,
Another beneficial aspect of computing is the increased access to more learning resources. The internet allows users to learn moe about history, new people, and current events. However, because the internet is so vast and hard to filter, it may lead to dangerous content for younger children.
A beneficial effect of computing is the conncection in fosters between people who aren't necessarily in the same place at the same time. However, the harmful effect of this can be the unsafe trends that and mob mentality culture that occurs on social media platforms.

Question 2:

Dopamine issues are not a consipiracy, in fact they can present a lot of issues to current highschool students. With the often overwhelming amount of homework a highschooler receives on average per night, it becomes easy to get distracted and get fixated on apps like tiktok, and instagram, which creates instant dopamine through endless, new content. For me, I feel like it's so easy to pickup my phone and get distracted on tiktok while doing my homework, which just takes me longer to do the assignment overall.

### 5.2 Activity
Question 1:

An important part of being a user in the digital world is being able to spread awareness. The internet is full of opposing opinions, viewpoints, data, statistics, and perspectives. A user can consult that, and use the internet to learn new skills that can help them become an active contributer to the digital world. They can build programs, and cool websites to support groups that need it, or spread awareness after consulting sources.
Question 2:

Like I said in the question above, a user could become a contributer to the digital world by building things that support other people. At Del Norte, we can build websites that are supporting/helping people (liek we are doing now), but we can even do something as simple as taking steps to decrease the digital divide, like donating old computers that still function to places that need it.
Question 3:

I think that red tape, or rules and regulations, can definitely be a barrier to decreasing the digital divide. For example, at Del Norte, we have certain websties that our blocked that might benefit our education further (educational youtube videos, our own deployed websites).
